# Employee-management



The input data file contains 740 records and 17 fields. The theme of the project is workplace absenteeism, and the file contains data about 740 employees.

The data from the file is read into a struct variable named absenteeism, and displayed in the console, despite the input file not specifying the number of records.

The user can choose to perform ascending sorting, where the selected sorting criterion will be moved to the first column. The options are:

a) by the monthly commuting cost for each employee

b) by the number of years each employee has been working at the company

c) by the number of hours absent in the previous year

After each sorting, the user can choose to sort again. Once all desired sorts have been performed, the user can proceed.

The following are calculated, printed to the console, and written to the output file:

The number of employees absent in each month

The number of employees with no absences

Also calculated, printed, and written to the output file:

The number of employees absent on each day of the week

Using user-defined functions (e.g., division, percentage, max, min, harmonic mean), the program also calculates:

The average monthly commuting distance between residence and workplace

The average age at which employees were hired

The maximum and minimum values of the average daily work coefficient (indicating individual work contribution)

The average employee performance

The percentage of employees with disciplinary sanctions

The percentage of alcohol consumers

The percentage of smokers

The average number of children

The average number of pets

The average weight

The average height

The average number of hours absent last year

The harmonic mean of the daily lost work coefficient due to absenteeism

The average number of days lost per employee, assuming 100% efficiency

A graphical representation of the number of absent employees per month for the previous year is also generated.

The database from which the input file was derived (17 out of 21 columns) is:
